Starter-Kit for gulp, jekyll, sass and jade
==========================================


This kit is originally based upon [shakyShane](https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync)

But it is updated. Mainly gulpfile.js. I added some error code so that when there is error in jade, sass code not to end up with brocken gulp.
This error code will leave gulp running but will report the error in the code
There is also added paths to the css, jade and jekyl input and output. So it is now easir to use this starterkit with diffent directory config.
